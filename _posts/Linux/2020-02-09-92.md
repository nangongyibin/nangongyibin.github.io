执行sudo apt-get install安装对应的软件出现如下错误

详细错误信息:

	E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
	E: Unable to acquire the dpkg frontend lock (/var/lib/dpkg/lock-frontend), is another process using it?

错误原因:是因为引用错误的链接导致的。

解决办法(删除这些引用即可):

	cd /var/lib/dpkg/updates
	rm -r ./*

删除完后，执行sudo apt-get update即可，这时就可以正常安装软件了。
